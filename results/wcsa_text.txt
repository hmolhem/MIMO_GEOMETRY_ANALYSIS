Weight-Constrained Sparse Arrays For Direction of
Arrival Estimation Under High Mutual Coupling
Pranav Kulkarni ,Student Member, IEEE and P. P. Vaidyanathan ,Life Fellow, IEEE
Abstract —In recent years, following the development of nested
arrays and coprime arrays, several improved array constructions
have been proposed to identify O(N2)directions with Nsensors
and to reduce the impact of mutual coupling on the direction ofarrival (DOA) estimation. However, having O(N
2)degrees of
freedom may not be of interest, especially for large N. Also, a
large aperture of such arrays may not be suitable when limitedspace is available to place the sensors. This paper presents twotypes of sparse array designs that can effectively handle highmutual coupling by ensuring that the coarray weights satisfyeitherw(1)=0o rw(1)=w(2)=0, where w(l)is the number
of occurrences of the difference lin the set {n
i−nj}N
i,j=1,
andniare sensors locations. In addition, several other coarray
weights are small constants that do not increase with the numberof sensors N. The arrays of the ﬁrst type have an aperture of
O(N)length, making them suitable when the available aperture
is restricted and the number of DOAs is also O(N). These arrays
are constructed by appropriately dilating a uniform linear array(ULA) and augmenting a few addi tional sensors. Despite having
an aperture of O(N)length, these arrays can still identify more
thanNDOAs. The arrays of the second type have O(N
2)
degrees of freedom and are suitable when the aperture is notrestricted. These arrays are constructed by appropriately dilatinga nested array and augmenting it with several additional sensors.We compare the proposed arrays with those in the literature byanalyzing their coarray propert ies and conducting several Monte-
Carlo simulations. Unlike ULA and nested array, any sensor pairin the proposed arrays has a spacing of at least 2 units, because ofthe coarray hole at lag 1. In the presence of high mutual coupling,the proposed arrays can estimate DOAs with signiﬁcantly smallererrors when compared to other arrays because of the reductionof coarray weight at critical small-valued lags.

I. INTRODUCTION
ARRAY signal processing has been a ﬁeld of active re-
search for several decades now [1]. In particular, direction
of arrival (DOA) estimation is an important application of sen-sor arrays in many domains, such as wireless communications,

is used to identify the angles θ1,θ2,...,θ Dfrom which the
Dsource signals impinge on the array. The difference coar-
rayDz={ni−nj}N
i,j=1is the set of all differences between
the sensor locations, and the coarray weights w(l)denote the
number of sensor pairs with distance lbetween them, i.e.
w(l)=|{(i,j)whereni−nj=l}| (2)
where|·|denotes the cardinality of th e set. It is well-known
that if the sources are uncorrelated, well-designed sparse arrays
can identify up to O(N2)DOAs through the ‘difference coarray
domain’. Minimum redundancy arrays (MRAs) [2]have long
been recognized to achieve this. However, ﬁnding optimal MRA
requires an exhaustive search, and tabulate d sensor positions are
available for only a small number of sensors [2],[3],[4].T h e
introduction of nested arrays [5]and coprime arrays [6], which
have closed-form expressions for sensor locations, has openedup a new direction for research in the design of sparse arrays.
Although nested arrays and coprime arrays can identify fewer
DOAs than an MRA with the same number of sensors, theirclosed-form expression for sensor positions for any Nmakes
them more practical and attractive.
A. Array Design Criteria and Their Drawbacks
Following the development of nested arrays and coprime ar-
rays, several generalizations of these arrays, such as generalized
coprime arrays [7]and improved nested arrays [8], have been
proposed. Several extensions of these arrays including super
nested arrays [9],[10], augmented nested arrays [11], dilated
nested arrays [12], MISC arrays [13], thinned coprime arrays
[14], and padded coprime arrays [15] have also been advanced.
The design of these arrays is based on three key principles:
1) Sensor locations should be easily describable using a
closed-form expression or simple generation rules.
2) The difference coarray of the array should have a long
central ULA segment, typically of O(N
2)length.
3) The number of sensor pairs with small separations should
be kept to a minimum.
The closed-form expression for sensor locations (criterion 1)
is necessary to create arrays easily for any given number of
sensorsN. The large central ULA segment of O(N2)length
in the coarray (criterion 2) is enforced to ensure that the arrays
can identify a large number of DOAs using coarray-based DOA

one-sided ULA segment in coarray
estimation algorithms such as coarray-MUSIC [5],[16],[17]
and coarray-ESPRIT [18]. However, such a large coarray means
that the array aperture will also be O(N2), which may not
be practical when a large number of sensors Nis used. It is
becoming more common to use almost a hundred sensors forlarge antenna arrays and massive MIMO in 6G technology [19],
[20]. With such a large number of sensors, it may no longer
be necessary for the arrays to have the capability to identify
O(N
2)sources because the number of DOAs is typically not
that large. In practical situations where the arrays are deployed,
such as in smartphones and self-driving cars, there may bephysical constraints on the array aperture. In such cases with
aperture constraints, an O(N
2)aperture may not be of interest
or desirable.
The third criterion above is to reduce the impact of mutual
coupling between sensors [9],[21],[22] on DOA estimation.
The exact impact of mutual coupling on the array output isunknown to the user and can be difﬁcult to model precisely.
However, the sensor pairs with small separations contribute the
most to the mutual coupling. Thus, to reduce the effect of mu-
tual coupling on DOA estimation error, the coarray weights for
small lags such as w(1),w(2), andw(3)that contribute the most
to the effect of mutual coupling are kept to a minimum (criterion
3). However, in order to ensure that the difference coarray of the
array has a large central ULA segment, these weights are still
non-zero. Even though some extensions of coprime arrays, such
as extended padded coprime array [15] and thinned coprime
array [14], can already achieve w(1)=w(2)=w(3)=1, the
presence of high mutual coupling m ay still result in poorer DOA
estimation because of non-zero w(1),w(2), andw(3).
To summarize, when dealing with arrays that have a large
number of sensors, we can relax the requirement of having
O(N
2)degrees of freedom (DOFs). Instead, other practical
considerations, such as aperture constraint and robustness tohigh mutual coupling, become a priority. To address these re-
quirements, we consider modiﬁcations to the second and third
array design criteria in this paper and accordingly design sparse
arrays. Table Isummarizes the modiﬁcations made and their
advantages and disadvantages. Sparse arrays with a closed formfor sensor positions, such as nested arrays and coprime ar-
rays, can identify fewer DOAs compared to MRAs. However,
they became popular because of the practical beneﬁt of havingclosed-form sensor locations (criterion 1) for any number of
sensors. By making modiﬁcations to the other two design cri-
teria as described in Table I, we further sacriﬁce the maximumnumber of identiﬁable DOAs, but in turn, achieve practical
beneﬁts such as improved robustness to high mutual coupling
and suitability under aper ture constraint.
B. Our Contributions and Connections to Literature
Adhering to the modiﬁed array design criteria, we ﬁrst de-
velop several sparse and weight-constrained arrays that have
O(N)aperture and either w(1)=0o rw(1)=w(2)=0. These
constructions are based on appropriately dilating a uniformlinear array (ULA) and augmenting it with a few additional
sensors. The one-sided ULA segments in the difference coar-
rays of these arrays start either from lag l=2o rl=3, and
the coarrays have only a few holes. Since these arrays have an
O(N)aperture, we can use more sensors than O(N
2)aperture
arrays when there is a ﬁxed aperture constraint. These arrays
are better suited when the aperture is constrained, the number
of DOAs DisO(N), and high mutual coupling is present. One
may wonder why we cannot use an N-sensor uniform linear
array (ULA) instead of the proposed O(N)aperture arrays.
This is because DOA estimation using ULA can suffer signif-icantly in the presence of mutual coupling due to the densely
packed sensors. Furthermore, an N-sensor ULA can identify
o n l yu pt o N−1 DOAs, whereas the proposed O(N)aperture
arrays can identify D>N DOAs (such as D=2N) through
the difference coarray domain, although these arrays no longer
haveO(N
2)degrees of freedom.
Next, for the situation where robustness to high mutual cou-
pling is needed but the array aperture is not constrained, we
propose another type of sparse and weight-constrained arrays.These arrays have either w(1)=0o rw(1)=w(2)=0 and
O(N
2)degrees of freedom. We achieve this by suitably dilating
a nested array and appending it with several extra sensors.
The one-sided ULA segment in the difference coarray of these
arrays starts either from l=2o rl=3 and has O(N2)length.
Through Monte-Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that in cer-
tain situations, our proposed arrays, having O(N2)aperture and
O(N2)degrees of freedom, can outperform arrays proposed
in the literature. Please not e that the propos ed arrays do not
have a central ULA segment in their difference coarrays (be-
causew(1)=0), unlike many other well-known sparse arrays.
However, we can still apply a modiﬁed coarray root-MUSIC
on the one-sided ULA segment of the coarray. It is important
to note that using a one-sided ULA segment from the coarrayreduces the number of identiﬁable DOAs using coarray-MUSIC

compared to the case when there exists a central ULA segment
in the coarray.
We now explain the novelty of our contributions in light of
what is already known about sparse arrays. To the best of our
knowledge, O(N)aperture arrays that can identify more DOAs
than the number of sensors have not been systematically devel-oped, or even mentioned in the litera ture before. Fur thermore, to
the best of our knowledge, all simulations in earlier papers con-
sidered a ﬁxed number of sensors N. Instead of only comparing
different array geometries for a ﬁxed number of sensors N,w e
also propose comparing different array geometries under a ﬁxed
aperture constraint. This can be called ‘aperture-constrained’evaluation of sensor arrays. To achieve good performance under
such aperture-cons trained setting, ‘apertu re-aware’ design of
sparse arrays is required. One way to do this is to explicitly
impose a strict constraint on the array aperture in the design
stage. In this paper, we take a different approach and propose aclass of array geometries with a smaller O(N)aperture instead
of a large O(N
2)aperture. Because of this, the proposed O(N)
aperture arrays can be more suitable than many other arraysfrom the literature under the apertu re constraint. In summary,
motivated by practical aperture constraints that certain applica-
tions may require, we propose an ‘aperture-constrained’ evalu-ation of sensor arrays and an ‘aperture-aware’ design approach,
through this paper. Such designs can be more practically useful
than the large O(N
2)aperture arrays for certain applications.
Similarly, arrays with w(1)=0o rw(1)=w(2)=0 are not
very common in the literature. The CADiS array proposed in
[7]is one such sparse array construction with a closed form
for sensor locations and w(l)=0 for small values of lsuch as
1,2,3, etc. However, CADiS arrays are not available for certain
numbers of sensors (such as 17, 23, and 29) [14]. Furthermore,
under aperture constraint, it may not be easy to come up with the
design parameters (integers M,N, andpfrom [7]such that M
andNare coprime and pis a divisor of M). Additionally, some
of our proposed arrays with O(N2)aperture can identify more
DOAs than CADiS with coarray-MUSIC, as we will see. Thisis because the one-sided ULA segment in the difference coarray
of CADiS does not start immediat ely after a few initial holes,
unlike the proposed arrays. Another array construction calledgeneralized nested array (GNA) [23] includes CADiS arrays as
their special case and shares the property that w(l)=0 for small
values of l. Similar to the CADiS array, it may not be easy to
decide design parameters (coprime integers αandβfrom [23]),
especially under aperture constraint. Some arrays tabulated in
[3]also have w(1)=0, but these are obtained through an elab-
orate search and do not have closed-form expressions for sensor
positions. The tabulation is available only for N≤20.
Some of the O(N)aperture arrays described in this work
were presented in our conference paper [24]. This journal paper
introduces several new arrays, presents extensive simulationsover and beyond [24], and provides a thorough comparison
with the arrays from the literature. The new contributions (and
outline) of this journal paper are as follows:
1) We discuss the drawbacks of the sparse array design
criteria and motivate modiﬁcations proposed in Table I
(Sec. I-A).2) We describe and justify the application of coarray-
MUSIC to a one-sided ULA segment in coarray (Sec. III).
3) We introduce new O(N)aperture arrays with w(1)=
w(2)=0 that can perform better than the O(N)aperture
arrays with w(1)=0 proposed in [24] (Sec. IV-C ,IV-D ).
4) We propose O(N
2)aperture arrays with w(1)=0 (Sec.
V-A)o rw(1)=w(2)=0 (Sec. V-B).
5) We compare the coarray properties and coarray-MUSIC
spectra of the proposed arrays with several arrays fromthe literature (Sec. VI-A ). We present extensive Monte-
Carlo simulations under two simulation settings (ﬁxed
N(Sec. VI-B ) and ﬁxed aperture A(Sec. VI-C )) to
thoroughly compare different arrays, and discuss when
we can expect the proposed arrays to perform well (Sec.
VI-E ).

As the sources are uncorrelated, the source covariance matrix P
is a diagonal matrix containing source powers pi=E(sisH

0, andσ2
nis the noise variance. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
is deﬁned as ¯p/σ2
n, where¯p=/summationtextD
i=1pi/Dis the average source

composition of /hatwideR

/hatwideRx=/hatwideE/hatwideΛ/hatwideEH(6)
where/hatwideΛis a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ordered in de-
creasing order of magnitude and /hatwideEcontains the corresponding
eigenvectors. The last N−Dcolumns of /hatwideEprovide an ap-
proximation to the ‘noise subspace’ (orthogonal complement
of the column span of A). Thus, the submatrix /hatwideEn(containing
the lastN−Dcolumns of /hatwideE) is used to either plot a MUSIC

spectrum P(ω), DOAs are estimated from the location of peaks.
Root-MUSIC estimates the DOAs from the phases of the D
complex-conjugate pairs of roots of Q(z)that are closest to
the unit circle. Root-MUSIC is usually applied if the array is
ULA (i.e. ni=i−1). The Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for DOA
estimation and analytical mean squared error expression forMUSIC and root-MUSIC are derived in [27],[28],[29].
A. Effect of Mutual Coupling Between Sensors
When sensors have electromagnetic coupling between them,
the array output does not follow the standard model (Eq. ( 3)).
This is called the mutual coupling effect, and it is challengingto precisely model mathematically [22]. In practice, it is usually
unknown to the user. In numerical simulations, the effect of
coupling is typically modeled as [9],[21],[30]
x[k]=CAs[k]+n[k], (9)
whereCis the coupling matrix with entries C
i,j=c|ni−nj|,
and the coupling coefﬁcients clare non-zero for l≤B. Here,
c0=1, and the rest of the non-zeros coupling coefﬁcients
cl,1≤l≤Bhave their magnitudes inversely proportional to l,
i.e.|cm/cn|=n/m . For ULA, Cis a banded Toeplitz matrix.
The coupling strength is characterized by |c1|=c. Another
metric to characterize the amount of mutual coupling is the
coupling leakage deﬁned as
L=||C−diag(C)||F
||C||F. (10)
where||·||Fdenotes the Frobenius norm. To mitigate the im-
pact of mutual coupling on DOA estimation, some papers [31],
[32],[33] estimate the coupling matrix along with the DOAs.
Another approach is to design sparse arrays in such a way that
the effect of mutual coupling on DOA estimation is reduced.This is the motivation for the sparse array design criterion,
which aims to reduce the weights w(1),w(2),andw(3)that
contribute the most to the mutual coupling effect. In this paper,we do not explicitly account for mutual coupling algorithmi-
cally but rather design sparse arrays that can effectively handle
the presence of mutual coupling. To the best of our knowledge,a Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for DOA estimation in the presence
of mutual coupling is not known in the literature.
B. A Note on the Practicality of the Mutual Coupling Model
While this basic phenomenon of coupling is a direct conse-
quence of Faraday’s law of induction, the actual application in
an antenna array is quite complicated (for example, see p. 475 of
[34], and [35]). Furthermore, the geometry of the antennas used
in the array (i.e., whether they are dipole antennas, sleeve dipole
antennas, spiral antennas, etc.) plays a role in determining themutual coupling behavior [36],[37],[38]. The coupling matrix
Cis actually the inverse of a so-called normalized impedance
matrixZ
0that has been used to model the self- and mutual-
coupling in the antenna elements [31],[39],[40],[41]. As seen
from these ref erences, there are multiple ways to formulate the
matrixZ0, and they yield quite different results. A summary
of different methods and their pros and cons can be found in
[35]. While these papers are insightful, they do not offer any
way to estimate the ratio c=|c1|which actually comes from
the inverse Z−1
0.
The element [Z0]k,m is proportional to zkmwhich is the
mutual impedance between the kth andmth sensor. These
impedances are approximately proportional to 1 /(nk−nm).
This is consistent with the fact that the radiation term for the
electric ﬁeld from an accelerated charge (as in the case of a
sinusoidal current in an antenna wire) varies as 1 /rrather than
as 1/r2(Chap. 28 of [42]). The 1/rassumption has been used
in the past, and it can be veriﬁed in the estimates of impedances
reported in Table 1 of [40] and Table 2 of [41]. The fact that the
dependence is not exactly of the form 1 /ris well known even
from basic examples such as can be found on page 189 of [43]
(e.g., setd>>a,b in Eqs. (10) and (11) therein).
Now, it is difﬁcult to see how the above assumption on
[Z0]k,m reﬂects in the matrix C. As explained earlier, it is
often assumed that Ci,j=c|ni−nj|and that|cm/cn|=n/m .
While this is similar to the properties of [Z0]k,m, it is hard to
give a theoretical justiﬁcation that the properties of Z0will be
inherited like this by the elements of the inverse C=Z−1
0.A
more detailed description of the difﬁculties involved in model-
ing mutual coupling can be found in [44]. However, this model
of mutual coupling has been widely used [9],[30],[31] in the
signal processing community and the same is used in this paper
as well.
As mentioned before, the goal of this paper is to design
sparse arrays that can effectively handle the presence of mutual
coupling without its explicit knowledge. That is, we do not
attempt to estimate the coupling matrix Cor compensate for its
effect algorithmically. In this paper, we simply apply coarray-
based DOA estimation with appropriate modiﬁcations, a brief
summary of which is provided next.

C. Coarray-Based DOA Estimation
Based on the eigendecomposition of /hatwideRx, one can identify

Instead, array output correlations can be ﬁrst estimated at each
laglin the difference coarray Dzas

ni−nj=l[/hatwideRx]i,j. (11)
The ideal array output correlations (obtained by using Rxin-
stead of/hatwideRxin Eq. ( 11)) have the form
R(l)=D/summationdisplay
i=1piejωil+σ2
nδ(l), (12)
whereδ(l)=1 whenl=0, and 0 otherwise. DOA estima-
tion performed using the estimated correlations /hatwideR(l),l∈Dz=
{ni−nj}N
i,j=1is called coarray-based DOA estimation. Note
thatDzcan contain up to N2−N+1 distinct elements and is
symmetric around 0. We use D+
zto refer to the non-negative
part ofDz.
Well-designed sparse arrays contain a large segment of con-
tiguous lags in Dz, which starts at L1and ends at L2(i.e.
w(l)/negationslash=0f o rL1≤l≤L2). Such a segment is called a ‘cen-
tral ULA segment’ when L1=−L2. For arrays with a central
ULA segment in the coarray, a coarray covariance matrix is
formed either by spatial smoothing ( /hatwideRSS)[5]or by direct-
augmentation approach ( /hatwideRDA)[17].A ss h o w ni n [17],/hatwideRDA
has entries [/hatwideRDA]m,n=/hatwideR(m−n)and/hatwideRSS=1
K/hatwideRDA/hatwideRH
DA.
Both/hatwideRDAand/hatwideRSSare Hermitian Toeplitz ma trices. Further-
more,/hatwideRSSis positive semideﬁnite, but /hatwideRDAmay not be. It
is equivalent to use either one of these matrices for subspace-
based DOA estimation when a large number of snapshots
are available. With limited snapshots, the direct-augmentationmethod can yield better performance as shown in [45].A st h e
central ULA segments can have lengths as large as O(N
2),
the matrices /hatwideRDAand/hatwideRSShave size O(N2)×O(N2), and
can thus identify up to O(N2)DOAs. The CRB for estimating
D≥NDOAs was derived in [46],[47] and an analytical mean
squared error expression for coarray-MUSIC was derived in[47]. Coarray-MUSIC is known to be asymptotically inefﬁcient
(i.e., MSE does not approach CRB, even for a large number
of snapshots and SNR) [47],[48]. Some alternate algorithms,
such as the weighted least squares [49] method, an augmented
Toeplitz matrix r econstruction approach [50], and a weighted
proxy covariance matrix construction approach [51], have been
proposed in the literature to im prove the efﬁciency of coarray-
based DOA estimation.
It is important to note that the fundamental assumption in
using sparse arrays and coarray-based estimation of more DOAs
than the number of sensors, is that the sources are uncorrelated.Such an assumption is difﬁcult to verify practically and it may
not hold, especially in the situa tions where multipath prop-
agation is possible. Developing algorithms and sparse arraysthat are robust to the presence of correlations is of practical
interest. One of the recent attempts in this direction is the
MESA algorithm [52] based on stochastic maximum likelihoodformulation. It is shown in [52] that coarray-based methods can
be sensitive to source correlations due to the destruction of the
Toeplitz covariance structure, and the MESA algorithm can be
robust to source correlations, especially when D<N . Further
research in this direction is required to enhance the practical
utility of sparse arrays.

The new arrays proposed in this paper do not have a central
ULA segment in the coarray, as they have w(1)=0. These
arrays have one-sided ULA segments in the coarray from lagL
1toL2where 0<L 1<L 2. In this section, we describe how
to estimate DOAs using such one-sided ULA segment of length
L=L2−L1+1 in the coarray, and show that up to ⌊L/2⌋
DOAs can be identiﬁed using the procedure described. This
procedure is similar to the direct-augmentation approach (with
matrix/hatwideRDA) described in Sec. II-C. However, there are some
subtleties involved as we explain next.
Similar to /hatwideRDA, based on the estimated correlations
/hatwideR(l),L1≤l≤L2, we can create a Toeplitz matrix /hatwideR:
/hatwideR=⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣/hatwideR(L
2−r1+1)... /hatwideR(L1)
/hatwideR(L2−r1+2).../hatwideR(L1+1)
.........
/hatwideR(L
2−1).../hatwideR(L1+r1−2)
/hatwideR(L2).../hatwideR(L1+r1−1)⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦(13)
The matrix /hatwideRhas sizer
1×r2, wherer1=⌊L/2⌋+1 andr2=
⌈L/2⌉, and its entries are /hatwideRm,n=/hatwideR(L2−r1+1+m−n).
Thek-th column of /hatwideRcontains r1consecutive correlations
starting from /hatwideR(L1+r2−k). Note that when L1=−L2,/hatwideR=
/hatwideRDA./hatwideRis a square matrix when Lis odd, whereas /hatwideRis a
tall matrix when Lis even. Even when /hatwideRis square, it is not a
Hermitian matrix in general, unlike /hatwideRDAand/hatwideRSS. We would
like to note that in [48], two variations of coarray-covariance
matrix (namely, ‘tall’ and ‘fat’ variations) were proposed. Here,
/hatwideRis formed in a similar way, but using the correlation entries
from a one-sided ULA segment in the coarray. Furthermore,
unlike that in [48], the size of /hatwideRis ﬁxed and does not depend on
the number of DOAs D. The dimensions (⌊L/2⌋+1)×⌈L/2⌉
of the matrix /hatwideRare chosen such that the number of DOAs we
can identify using a subspace-based algorithm is maximized.
As explained next, up to ⌊L/2⌋DOAs can be identiﬁed by
computing singular value decomposition (SVD) of /hatwideR.
To see this, ﬁrst consider an ideal version of the matrix
/hatwideR, with entries R(l)instead of /hatwideR(l). With a large number of
snapshots, the matrix /hatwideRconverges to the ideal r1×r2matrix
Rwith entries
[R]m,n=R(L2−r1+1+m−n) (14)
As the ideal correlations R(l)have the sum-of-sinusoids form
(Eq. ( 12)), the last (i.e. r2-th) column of Rcontaining entries

Similarly, the k-th column of Rcan be expressed as
R(:,k)=A
cbk (16)
wherebkis aD-dimensional vector with m-th entry [bk]m=
pmejωm(L1+r2−k). Collecting such equations for all columns of
R(i.e. fork=1,...,r 2), we get
R=AcPBH

ejωn(m−1),Pis aD×Ddiagonal matrix containing source
powersp1,...,p D, andBcis anr2×Dmatrix with entries
[Bc]m,n=e−jωn(L1+r2−m). Since the DOAs ω1,...,ω Dare
distinct, as long as r1≥Dandr2≥Dthe Vandermonde ma-
tricesAcandBchave rank D. Thus, using Sylvester’s rank
inequality for matrices, it can be concluded that matrix Ralso
has rankD.N o w ,a s AcandRhave the same rank D, and any
vectorxsatisfying xHAc=0 also satisﬁes xHR=0 (from Eq.
(17)), it can be concluded that matrices AcandRhave the same
column spans.
In practice, we only have access to the matrix /hatwideR. We can es-
timate the column span of Ac(and its orthogonal complement)
through an SVD of /hatwideR:
/hatwideR=/hatwideU/hatwideΣ/hatwideVH, (18)
where/hatwideUis anr1×r1matrix with orthonormal columns, and
/hatwideΣis anr1×r2matrix containing singular values arranged
in descending order along the principal diagonal. The ﬁrst D
columns of /hatwideUprovide an approximation to the column span of
Ac. The matrix /hatwideUncontaining the last r1−Dcolumns of /hatwideU
provides an approximation to the ‘noise subspace’ (the orthog-
onal complement of Ac). As long as D<r 1, we obtain a non-
trivial noise subspace with a dimension of at least one. Thus,
by using /hatwideUnin place of /hatwideEn, andac(z)(where[ac(z)]i=zi−1)
in place of a(z)in Eq. ( 8), we can get a coarray root-MUSIC
polynomial, from which the DOAs can be estimated.
In summary, even when /hatwideRis not a square matrix, we can
apply SVD to estimate signal subspace and noise subspacefrom/hatwideRand use coarray-based root-MUSIC to estimate DOAs
using the one-sided ULA segment from the difference coarray.
Note that D<r
1andD≤r2for the above-described method to
work. Thus, to maximize the number of DOAs we can identify
using this approach, min(r1−1,r2)should be as large as pos-
sible. As we only have the Lcontiguous correlation estimates
/hatwideR(L1),...,/hatwideR(L2)to form the Teoplitz matrix /hatwideR,r1andr2
should also satisfy r1+r2−1=L. Under this constraint, it
can be veriﬁed that the largest value for min(r1−1,r2)is ob-
tained when r1=⌊L/2⌋+1 andr2=⌈L/2⌉. Thus it is possi-
ble to identify a maximum of r1−1=⌊L/2⌋DOAs in this way
by applying SVD to the matrix /hatwideRof size(⌊L/2⌋+1)×⌈L/2⌉.We would like to note that some previous papers such as
[7],[14] have reported DOA estimation performance using a
subspace-based algorithm with CADiS arrays that have one-sided ULA segment in coarray. However, they do not describe
or justify their method for identifying DOAs using such one-
sided ULA segment in coarray, or derive the maximum num-ber of identiﬁable sources. In fact, the number of identiﬁable
sources reported in [14] for CADiS array when using subspace-
based DOA estimation is one less than ⌊L/2⌋whenLis even.
It is possible to use techniques other than coarray-based
algorithms to identify more DOAs than the number of sensors.
Some examples include the weighted least squares method [49],
stochastic maximum likelihood estimation [52], and dictionary-
based methods [53]. This paper primarily focuses on introduc-
ing new sparse arrays that can handle strong mutual coupling
and aperture constraints, rather than focusing on various algo-
rithms that can be applied for DOA estimation. With suitableadaptations, it is possible to use other DOA estimation algo-
rithms with the proposed arrays. This section demonstrated the
adaptation of widely used coarray-MUSIC for one-sided ULAsegments in the difference coarray.

ROPOSED WEIGHT- CONSTRAINED SPARSE ARRAYS WITH
O(N)APERTURE
In this section, we ﬁrst systematically develop sparse arrays
that have an aperture of O(N)length and w(1)=0. We will
start by explaining a procedure to generate such arrays byproperly dilating a ULA and adding a few extra sensors. We will
then propose modiﬁcations to the construction to make other
crucial weights ( w(2)andw(3)) small constants independent
ofNwhile keeping w(1)=0. We will also develop sparse ar-
rays that have O(N)aperture and w(1)=w(2)=0. Moreover,
we will discuss further modiﬁcations to make w(3)andw(4)
small constants independent of N. The coarray properties of
the arrays proposed in this section are summarized in Table II.
These arrays will be called ‘weight-constrained sparse arrays’.
We assume N> 5 to ensure that the general expressions for all
arrays are valid.
A. Proposed Sparse Arrays With O(N)Aperture and
w(1)=0
We want to create a sparse array with O(N)aperture and
w(1)=0. We also want to ensure that the array has a large
ULA segment in its coarray from lag two onwards for easyapplication of coarray root-MUSIC. To achieve this we follow
these steps:
1) Expand an ( N−1)-sensor ULA by a factor of two to cre-
ate a ‘2-sparse’ ULA {0,
2,...,2(N−2)}. This is called
the array dilation step.
2) Place the N-th sensor at location 2 N−1. This is called
the array augmentation step.
Thus, we get the array:
z1=/bracketleftbig
/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright
2-sparse ULA024 ... 2(N−2)2N−1/bracketrightbig

Note that the coarray of the 2-sparse ULA consists only of
the even lags from −2(N−2)to 2(N−2). The augmented
sensor is placed at a distance three from the last sensor of the
2-sparse ULA and is at odd distances from the other N−1 sen-
sors. This creates lags 3 ,5,..., 2N−1 in the coarray, which
were missing from the coarray of the 2-sparse ULA. Thus, the
coarrayD+
z1ofz1is
D+
z1={0,/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright
One-sided ULA segment in coarray2,3,4,..., 2N−4,2N−3,2N−1} (20)
The array z1has an aperture A=2N−1 and its coarray
includes a ULA segment of length L=2N−4 starting from
L1=2 and ending at L2=2N−3. Since the coarray is sym-
metric, it also contains a ULA segment from −L2to−L1.A s
explained in Sec. III, we can identify up to ⌊L/2⌋=N−2
DOAs by using coarray root-MUSIC with this array. AlthoughanN-sensor ULA can identify one more DOA than z
1,t h e
proposed array can tolerate mutual coupling better than the
ULA, as we will see in Section VI, because it has w(1)=0.
Note that the coarray D+
z1has two holes l ocated at positions
1 and 2N−2. It is not possible to eliminate the extra hole at
position 2 N−2. For any array that has w(1)=0,w(A−1)
must also be zero. This is because there are sensors at 0 and
Afor an array with aperture A. No sensor can be placed at
either location 1 or A−1, as that will create a sensor pair
with separation 1. With no sensors at 1 and A−1,w(A−1)
must be zero. Thus, there are no holes in the coarray D+
z1apart
from those that arise as a necessary consequence of our design
constraint w(1)=0.
B. Further Reducing w(2)andw(3)
Even though the array z1can make w(1)equal to zero, it has
w(2)equal toN−2 because of the 2-sparse ULA segment in
the array. To further reduce the mutual coupling, we need to
construct an array where w(2)is a small constant independentof the number of sensors, while also ensuring that w(1)is zero.
To achieve this, we can start with a ‘3-sparse’ ULA having(N−2)sensors and add two more sensors at a distance of
either 2 or 4 units from the same end or opposite ends of the
3-sparse ULA.
Augmenting both sensors on the same side gives the array:
z(1)
2=/bracketleftbig
/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright
3-sparse ULA036 ... 3(N−3)3N−73N−5/bracketrightbig
,
(21)
and its coarray is D+
z(1)
2={0,2,3,..., 3N−8,3N−7,
3N−5}. The ULA segment in the coarray (underlined) is from
L1=2t oL2=3N−7. Similar to the previous design, the
coarray has only two holes l ocated at positions 1 and 3 N−6(=
A−1). An important advantage of this design over z1is that
w(2)=2, independent of the number of sensors Nused. This
further reduces the impact of mutual coupling compared to the
previous design z1. However, z(1)
2has larger aperture than z1.
Instead of placing both additional sensors on the same side,
they can be placed on opposite sides of the 3-sparse ULA:
z(2)
2=/bracketleftbig
−2/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright
3-sparse ULA036 ... 3(N−3)3N−5/bracketrightbig
.(22)
By doing so, w(2)now becomes 1 instead of 2. The coarray
still has ULA segment from 2 to 3 N−7, but the array aperture
is now 3N−3 instead of 3 N−5, and the coarray D+
z(2)
2has
three holes at 1, 3 N−6(=A−3), and 3N−4(=A−1).
The arrays z(1)
2andz(2)
2makew(2)a constant independent
of the number of sensors N, but their w(3)increases linearly
withNbecause of the 3-sparse ULA segment in the array. To
makew(1)=0 and both w(2)andw(3)small constants, we
propose the following construction. We use a 4-sparse ULA of
N−3 sensors with appropriately placed three other sensors:
z(1)
3=/bracketleftbig
−2/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright
4-sparse ULA04... 4(N−4)4N−13 4N−11/bracketrightbig

The advantage of this array over z(1)
3is thatw(2)is reduced to
1. In the next subsection, to further reduce the impact of mutual
coupling, we develop sparse arrays with w(1)=w(2)=0.
C. Proposed Arrays With O(N)Aperture and
w(1)=w(2)=0
We can construct O(N)aperture arrays that have both
w(1)=w(2)=0 by using a similar construction mechanism
of ULA dilation and augmentation. Consider an array with 3-sparse ULA of N−2 sensors and two additional sensors placed
at distances of 4 and 5 units from the opposite ends of the 3-
sparse ULA:
z
4=/bracketleftbig
−5/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright
3-sparse ULA036 ... 3(N−3)3N−5/bracketrightbig
.(25)
The sensor located at 3 N−5 is positioned at a distance
of 4 from one end of the 3-sparse ULA. This sensor pro-
duces differences {4,7,10,..., 3N−5}with the sensors of
the 3-sparse ULA. On the other hand, the sensor at −5i s
located at a distance of 5 from the opposite end of the 3-
sparse ULA and creates differences {5,8,11,..., 3N−4}
with the sensors of the 3-sparse ULA. When combined withthe self-differences {0,3,6,..., 3(N−3)}created by the
sensor pairs within 3-sparse ULA, we get that the coarray
ofz
4isD+
z4={0,3,4,5...,3(N−3),3N−8,3N−7,3N−
5,3N−4,3N}. The largest difference of 3 Nis between the
two augmented sensors.
This array with an aperture of length 3 Nhasw(1)=w(2)=
0. Its coarray contains a ULA segment starting from L1=3
and ending at L2=3N−7. It can identify up to ⌊(3N−9)/2⌋
DOAs using coarray root-MUSIC. In addition to the holes at 1,
and 2, the coarray has four additional holes located at 3 N−6,
3N−3, 3N−2, and 3N−1.D. Further Reducing w(3)andw(4)
Although z4hasw(1)=w(2)=0, itsw(3)increases as N
increases. To make w(3)constant we consider the following
array:
z5=/bracketleftbig−5/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright
4-sparse ULA048 ... 4(N−4)4N−13 4N−10/bracketrightbig
.
(26)
Arrayz5consists of a 4-sparse ULA of N−3 sen-
sors and three additional s ensors placed at positions −5,
4N−13, and 4 N−10. The 4-sparse ULA creates self-
differences 4 [[0,N−4]]in the coarray. The sensor at lo-
cation−5 is at a distance 5 from the 4-sparse ULA seg-
ment, and creates differences 4 [[1,N−3]]+1. The sensor
at location 4 N−13 is at distance 3 from the 4-sparse ULA
segment, and creates differences 4 [[1,N−3]]−1. The sen-
sor at location 4 N−10 is at distance 6 from the 4-sparse
ULA segment, and creates differences 4 [[1,N−3]]+2. Com-
bined with the additional differences 4 N−8 and 4N−5
between the augmented sensors, we get that the coarray of
z5isD+
z5={0,3,4,5,..., 4N−13,4N−11,4N−10,4N−
8,4N−5}. The ULA segment in the coarray is from L1=3
toL2=4N−13. The coarray has four holes in addition to the
holes at positions 1 and 2.
The ﬁrst three weights w(l),1≤l≤3o fz5do not increase
withN. We can go a step further to also make w(4)a constant
by considering the following array:
z6=/bracketleftbig−7−4/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright
5-sparse ULA05... 5(N−5)5N−22 5N−19/bracketrightbig

(27)
Arrayz6consists of a 5-sparse ULA of N−4 sensors
and four augmented sens ors placed at positions −7,−4,
5N−22, and 5 N−19. The 5-sparse ULA creates self-
differences 5 [[0,N−5]]. The sensor at location 5 N−19
creates differences 5 [[1,N−4]]+1, the sensor at location
−7 creates differences 5 [[1,N−4]]+2, the sensor at loca-
tion 5N−22 creates differences 5 [[1,N−4]]−2, and the
sensor at location −4 creates differences 5 [[1,N−4]]−1
with the sensors from the 5-sparse ULA segment. Combined
with the additional differences 5 N−12 and 5 N−15 be-
tween the augmented sensors, we get that the coarray ofz

w(3)=3, andw(4)=w(6)=w(7)=w(8)=w(9)=1, and
w(5)=N−5. Out of the ﬁrst nine coarray weights w(l),1≤
l≤9, onlyw(5)increases with the number of sensors N. There
are ﬁve holes in addition to the holes at positions 1 and 2 in the
coarray.
V. P ROPOSED WEIGHT- CONSTRAINED NESTED ARRAYS WITH
O(N2)APERTURE
In this section, we develop sparse arrays with O(N2)aperture
that have either w(1)=0o rw(1)=w(2)=0. For arrays in the
previous section, we expanded a ULA and added a few extra
sensors. For O(N2)aperture arrays, we will start by expanding
a nested array. However, we will need to add several extrasensors to ensure that the coarray has a ULA segment from lag 2
or 3 onwards. These arrays will be called ‘weight-constrained
nested arrays’. These arrays are well-suited for identifying alarge number of DOAs under high mutual coupling, as we will
see in Sec. VI. However, they have large apertures, and so they
are not suitable when there is an aperture constraint. Coarrayproperties of the arrays described in this section are summarized
in Table III.
A. Weight-Constrained Nested Arrays With w(1)=0
Consider a standard nested array [5]z
n=P1∪P2where,
P1=[[1,N1]]andP2=(N1+1)[[1,N2]]. We assume that
N1>3, so that the general expressions are valid. The coarray of
the nested array is D+
zn=[[0,(N1+1)N2−1]]. Now consider
the array
w(1)
1=(2P1)∪(2P2)∪P3, (28)
whereP3=2P2+3. This array w(1)
1is formed by ﬁrst ex-
panding a nested array to create a ‘2-sparse’ nested array(2P
1)∪(2P2)and appending it with another sparse ULA seg-
mentP3containing N2sensors.P3is just a shifted version
of 2P2to the right by three units. Note that the coarray of
the dilated nested array (2P1)∪(2P2)only contains even lags
from−2(N1+1)N2+2t o2(N1+1)N2−2. Thus, we ap-
pendP3to ﬁll up the missing odd lags (except the lag 1, to
ensurew(1)=0). The array has a total of N1+2N2sensors
and its aperture A=2(N1+1)N2+1 is slightly larger than
twice that of the original nested array zn. We will now prove
that the coarray of w(1)
1has a ULA segment from L1=2t o
L2=2(N1+1)N2−1.
Lemma 1: The difference coarray D+
w(1)
1ofw(1)

ULA segment from L1=2t oL2=2(N1+1)N2−1.
Proof: As the difference coarray of the nested array is D+
zn=
[[0,(N1+1)N2−1]], it is easy to see that all even differences
f r o m0t o2 (N1+1)N2−2 are created by the sensors from
(2P1)∪(2P2). Now consider the ﬁrst sensor from P3located
at 2(N1+1)+3. It creates odd differences {3,5,..., 2(N1+
1)+1}=2[[1,(N1+1)]]+ 1 with the sensors from 2 P1∪
{2(N1+1)}. Similarly, the k-th sensor in P3located at 2 (N1+
1)k+3 creates differences of the form 2 [[1,(N1+1)]]+
2(N1+1)(k−1)+1 with the sensor from 2 P1∪{2(N1+

fork∈[[1,N2]]), we get that P3generates all odd differences
from 2[[1,(N1+1)N2]]+1. Furthermore, when N1>1, there
are no sensor pairs with unit separation, and thus w(1)=
w(A−1)=0. Thus, we have proved that the difference coarray
ofw(1)
1isD+
w(1)

1)N2+1}which contains a ULA segment from L1=2t o
L2=2(N1+1)N2−1.
The array has w(1)=0, and the difference coarray Dw(1)
1has only two holes, one at location 1 and the other at location
A−1. The length of the ULA segment in the coarray is L=
L2−L1+1=2(N1+1)N2−2, and thus the number of iden-
tiﬁable DOAs is ⌊L/2⌋=(N1+1)N2−1, which is same as
the number of identiﬁable DOAs with the original nested array
zn. However w(1)
1usesN2additional sensors compared to zn.
Furthermore, when N1>3, it can be veriﬁed that w(2)=N1,
w(3)=N2,w(4)=N1−1, andw(5)=1.
For a total number of sensors N, optimal N1andN2to

ues ofN1andN2, the maximum number of identiﬁable DOAs is
O(N2)(approximately (N+1)2/8−2). Thus, the array w(1)

constrained MRAs (cMRA) [3]. See Sec. VI-A for details.
Note that P3is a 2(N1+1)-sparse ULA of N2sensors
placed at a distance three to the right of the sensors at location
2(N1+1). It was introduced to ﬁll up the odd-valued differ-
ences missing from the coarray of the expanded nested array.
These odd valued differences are created between the sensors
fromP3and the sensors from the (N1+1)-sensor 2-sparse
ULA segment given by 2 P1∪{2(N1+1)}. Noting this, we can
consider the following variation of the array
w(2)
1=(2P1)∪(2P2)∪P/prime
3, (30)
whereP/prime
3=2P2−2N2(N1+1)−1. Here, the 2 (N1+1)-
sparse ULA segment of N2sensorsP/prime
3is placed three units to
the left of the sensor at location 2, instead of placing it three
units to the right of the sensor at 2 (N1+1). Thus, it creates
the same set of odd-valued differences with the 2-sparse ULAsegment 2 P
1∪{2(N1+1)}. Hence, it can be shown similar to
Lemma 1that array w(2)
1also has the same ULA segment in its
coarray from L1=2t oL2=2(N1+1)N2−1. However, the
aperture of w(2)
1is roughly twice that of w(1)
1, and its coarray
has many holes, unlike that of w(1)
1which had only two holes.
By shifting the P3to the other side of the nested array, w(3)reduces from N2to 1. Thus, array w(2)
1has reduced mutual
coupling, at the cost of a larger aperture compared to w(1)
1.
B. Weight-Constrained Nested Arrays With w(1)=w(2)=0
To create a sparse array with O(N2)degrees of freedom and
w(1)=w(2)=0, we expand a nested array by a factor of 3
and augment it with two additional appropriately placed sparse
ULA segments. Consider the array
w2=(3P1)∪(3P2)∪P4∪P5 (31)
whereP1=[[1,N1]]andP2=(N1+1)[[1,N2]], and
P4=3P2−3N2(N1+1)−1 (32)
P5=3P2+5 (33)
HereP4andP5are 3(N1+1)-sparse ULA segments of N2
sensors placed at distances of 4 and 5 units, respectively, from
the opposite ends of the 3-sparse ULA segment 3 P1∪{3(N1+
1)N2}. Arrayw2has a total of N1+3N2sensors, and its
apertureA=3(N1+1)(2N2−1)+6, which is roughly six
times that of the original nested array zn. Similar to Lemma
1, it can be shown that w2has a ULA segment in its coarray
fromL1=3t oL2=3(N1+1)N2−1.

Lemma 2: The difference coarray D+
w2ofw2contains a ULA
segment from L1=3t oL2=3(N1+1)N2−1.
The proof is similar to that of Lemma 1, and details
are omitted due to space constr aints. The main idea is that
the dilated nested array (3P1)∪(3P2)creates self-differences
3[[0,(N1+1)N2−1]]. The sensors from P4create dif-
ferences 3 [[1,(N1+1)N2−1]]+1 with the sensors from
3P1∪{3(N1+1)N2}. The sensors from P5create differ-
ences 3[[1,(N1+1)N2−1]]+2 with the sensors from 3 P1∪
{3(N1+1)N2}. Combining the three sets of differences, a
ULA segment from L1=3t oL2=3(N1+1)N2−1 is ob-
tained.
Arrayw2hasw(1)=w(2)=0. However, it has a large
aperture and contains several holes in its difference coarray.
The length of the one-sided ULA segment in its coarray is
L=3(N1+1)N2−3, and thus it can identify up to ⌊L/2⌋≈
1.5(N1+1)N2−2 DOAs with coarray-MUSIC. However w2
uses 2N2additional sensors compared to zn. It can be veriﬁed
that when N1>3,w(3)=N1,w(4)=1, andw(5)=N2.
GivenNsensors, the optimal N1andN2to maximize the
ULA segment in the coarray of w2are found by solving
max
N1,N23(N1+1)N2−3
s.t.N1+3N2=N (34)
The optimal solution to the above problem is given by N2=
round((N+1)/6), andN1=N−3N2. With the optimal val-
ues ofN1andN2, the maximum number of identiﬁable DOAs
isO(N2)(approximately (N+1)2/8−2). Thus, the array w2
hasw(1)=w(2)=0 and can identify O(N2)DOAs using
coarray-MUSIC.
VI. S IMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we compare our proposed weight-constrained
arrays (with O(N)aperture array from Sec. IVas well as
O(N2)aperture arrays from Sec. V) with other sparse arrays
from the literature. Out of seve ral generalizations of nested
arrays [5], we choose the following four in our comparisons.
Super nested arrays (SNA) [9],[10] have the same length of
difference coarray as the parent nested arrays, but are more
robust to mutual coupling because of reduced coarray weights
at small lags. Therefore, we use SNA for comparison instead ofnested arrays. We use a third-order super nested array (SNA3) if
available, and if not, a second-order super nested array (SNA2)
is used. Augmented nested arrays (ANA) [11] are formed by
rearranging and distributing the sensors from the dense subarray
of the nested array on the two sides of the sparse subarray
of the nested array. Out of the four variations of ANAs, we
use ANAII-2, which has the largest DOFs and small mutual
coupling compared to other variations. Recently proposed vari-ations of nested arrays called dilated nested arrays (DNA) and
displaced DNA (DDNA) [12] are also used in comparisons. All
these modiﬁcations of the nested array require two parametersN
1andN2for construction. For a given total number of sensors,
optimal values of N1andN2are used for each array. One key
drawback of all these variations of nested arrays is that w(2)of these arrays increases linearly with N1(and optimal N1is
proportional to N).
We also include MRAs [2]in our comparison, but MRAs
are available only for a limited number of sensors [2],[4].
In[3], the authors performed a restricted search for MRAs
forN≤20 and tabulated the (approximate) MRAs they found
using their restricted search. They also noted a general pattern
of sensor locations in the arrays they obtained. The maximum
inter-element spacing constraint (MISC) arrays [13] seem to
be motivated by this general closed-form pattern noticed in
[3]. In addition, the authors of [3]compiled another set of
arrays, which we call constrained-MRAs (cMRA). These arraysmaximize the ULA segment in the difference coarray under
the constraint that w(1)=0. The tabulated cMRAs in [3]are
only an approximation to the ideal cMRAs because of the
restricted search performed. As these arrays have w(1)=0,
they can effectively mitigate m utual coupling, as we will see
in the simulations.
Out of several generalizations of coprime arrays (CPA) [6],
we choose the following four in our comparisons. CADiS array[7]is generated by displacing and compressing one of the sparse
ULAs of a coprime array. These arrays can have w(l)=0f o r
several small values of land hence can effectively mitigate
mutual coupling, similar to the proposed arrays. However, as
noted in Sec. I-B, the ULA segment in the difference coarray
of CADiS does not start immediat ely after the few initial holes
unlike the proposed arrays, and hence the maximum number of
identiﬁable DOAs can be smaller than our proposed arrays as
well will see. Furthermore, CADiS requires 3 design parameters(M,N, andpfrom [7]such that MandNare coprime and
p>1 divides M). For a given total number of sensors, or a
ﬁxed aperture, it is not easy to come up with optimal parameters
that maximize the ULA segment in the coarray of CADiS,
without enumerating all possib ilities of design parameters ( M,
N, andpfrom [7]). Furthermore, for a certain number of sensors
(such as 17, 23, and 29), there are no possible CADiS array
constructions
[14]. Another modiﬁcation of coprime arrays we
use for comparison is thinned coprime array (TCA) [14]. It has
the same aperture and DOFs as the original coprime array but
with fewer sensors and smaller coarray weights than the originalcoprime array. Four variations of padded coprime arrays (PCA)
are proposed in [15] by characterizing hole locations in a tai-
lored CADiS array and ﬁlling up those holes by augmenting asmall number of additional sensors. Out of these, extended PCA
(ePCA) has the longest ULA segment in the coarray. Impres-
sively, ePCA (with parameters MandNfrom [15]) can achieve
w(l)=1,1≤l≤M−1 whenMis odd. In some simulations,
we also consider the enhanced and generalized coprime array
(EGCA) [54], which can have a larger ULA segment in coarray
and smaller mutual coupling than other variations of coprime
arrays.
In Section VI-A , we compare the coarray properties for vari-
ous arrays and illustrate coarr ay-MUSIC spectra obtained when
estimating D>N DOAs. We then conduct two types of Monte-
Carlo simulations. The ﬁrst set of simulations compares differ-
ent arrays when the number of sensors Nis ﬁxed, and the array
apertures can differ. The second set of simulations involves

can vary. Each data point in the graphs is averaged over 1000Monte-Carlo trials in every Monte-Carlo simulation. In these
trials, the source amplitudes s[k]and noise realizations n[k]
are randomly chosen according to the signal model described
in Sec. II. All sources are assumed to have equal powers. To
estimate DOAs with sparse arrays, we use the coarray root-MUSIC algorithm, as described in Sec. III, using the largest
ULA segment (possibly one-sided) in the difference coarray. As
for the ULA, we apply direct (i.e., using /hatwideR
x) root-MUSIC, as
it usually performs better than coarray root-MUSIC [47],[48].

for coupling coefﬁcients have been used in most of the previous
papers on sparse arrays [9],[12],[14],[15], and we use the
same values in all our simulations here for consistency. In [24],
it was noted that the DOA estimation performance may vary
based on the phases of the coupling coefﬁcients chosen. Further
research is required to understand the effect of the phases ofmutual coupling coefﬁcients on DOA estimation.
A. Array Properties and Coarray-MUSIC Spectra
We now compare the coarray properties of the proposed
arrays with the well-known arrays discussed in the previous
subsection for a ﬁxed number of sensors, N=16. For nested ar-
ray variations, array designs with optimal N
1andN2that max-
imize the number of identiﬁable DOAs are chosen. Similarly,an optimal pair of coprime integers that maximize the number
of identiﬁable DOAs is chosen for coprime array. The same
design parameters are chosen for ePCA. Out of possible TCAconﬁgurations, we choose the array that can identify the most
number of DOAs. Out of possible CADiS conﬁgurations, we
choose the one with w(l)=0f o rl=1,2 for a fair comparisonwith the proposed arrays. Fig. 1plots the coarray weights w(l)
for 0≤l≤40. It is observed that although the proposed arrays
have some large weights, the weights that contribute the most
to the mutual coupling effect are either zero or relatively small.
With ﬁxed N=16, each array has a different aperture Aand
the maximum number of identiﬁable DOAs using coarray root-
MUSIC (D
m), as shown in Table IV. The proposed O(N)aper-
ture arrays have a relatively smaller aperture and can identify
f e w e rD O A st h a n O(N2)aperture arrays. The coupling leakage
values (L) in Table IVare calculated with c=0.3 andB=10
(Eq. ( 10)). The coupling leakage is found to be smallest for z6,
followed next by CADiS, w2, andz5. Coarray weights w(l)for
1≤l≤5 are also shown in the Table. Only the proposed arrays,
CADiS, and cMRA have w(1)=0. Although CADiS has a
small mutual coupling, it can identify fewer DOAs compared
to the proposed O(N2)aperture arrays w(1)
1,w(2)
1, andw2.
Next, we consider the task of estimating D=22(>N=
16)DOAs uniformly spaced in the ωdomain from −0.9π
to 0.9πwith these arrays. SNR of 0 dB and 100 snapshots
are considered. Note that ULA, z1, andz(2)
2, andz4cannot
identify 22 DOAs with coarray-MUSIC as they have Dm<22.
These arrays will be included in the comparisons in the next
subsections for simulations with smaller D.F i g . 2shows the
coarray-MUSIC spectra obtained for the rest of the arrays. Weobserve that arrays that do not have w(1)=0 do not produce
correct peaks in the coarray-MUSIC spectra for some DOAs.
On the other hand, the proposed arrays, CADiS, and cMRA caneffectively mitigate the eff ect of mutual coupling and produce
peaks in the coarray-MUSIC spectra corresponding to all 22
DOAs. The DOA estimation MSE is also small for these arrays
withw(1)=0, as shown in the last column of Table IV.
B. Monte-Carlo Simulations With a Fixed Number of Sensors
With the same set of arrays with N=16 sensors, we perform
Monte-Carlo simulations to compare DOA estimation perfor-
mance. First, for the simulations in Fig. 3, we consider D=6
DOAs spaced uniformly in the ωdomain from −0.8πto 0.8π.
We consider SNR of 5 dB, 500 snapshots, and coupling strength
c=0.5. Out of these three, we ﬁx two quantities at a time
and vary the third quantity to measure its impact on DOA

estimation error. We see that in this situation, with a relatively
small number of sensors and few DOAs, many of the proposedarrays perform worse than the other sparse arrays. However,
notably,z
6performs the best in this situation for a large range
ofc, SNR, and snapshots. Array z6performs well because it
hasw(1)=w(2)=0, and small w(3)andw(4), which makes
it robust to the presence of high mutual coupling. In particular,in Fig. 3(a) we see that the increase in MSE for the proposed
arrays is gradual as the coupling strength cis increased. In
contrast, for most of the other arrays, MSE increases drasticallyascincreases beyond a certain point. The sudden increase in
MSE usually indicates some of the DOAs being misidentiﬁed
(similar to the case in Fig. 2). Despite having a smaller aperture
and shorter ULA segment in coarray compared to the other
O(N
2)aperture arrays, we see from Fig. 3(b) and 3(c) thatz6
performs better when SNR is larger than 0 dB and more than
100 snapshots are used.
Next, we change the number of DOAs to D=20 and repeat
the above set of simulations. The DOAs are spaced uniformlyfrom−0.9πto 0.9πin theωdomain. In Fig. 4w es e eac l e a r
separation between the arrays based on whether w(1)=0o r
not. Arrays with w(1)=0 (irrespective of whether the aperture
isO(N)orO(N
2)) have smaller MSE than arrays for which
w(1)/negationslash=0. The MSE for z(2)
2is large because D=20 DOAs
is barely within the maximum number of identiﬁable DOAs
(Dm) with this array (see Table IV). From Fig. 4(a) note that
forc≤0.2, proposed arrays have larger MSE than most other
arrays. For such small mutual coupling, the arrays with larger
lengths of the ULA segment in coarray have smaller MSE. Thisindicates that for small mutual coupling, making w(1)=0t o
reduce mutual coupling is not as critical as it is when the high
mutual coupling is present ( c>0.2). We see a similar ordering
of arrays in Fig. 4(b) and 4(c). The MSEs saturated to a high
value are indicative of misidentiﬁed DOAs. This simulationmakes it clear that under high mutual coupling and for larger
D,w(1)=0 is required to correctly identify the DOAs.
C. Monte-Carlo Simulations Under Aperture Constraint

constrained by the available aperture, in practical applications.TABLE V

To compare array performance under such practical constraints,
we consider a situation where a maximum aperture of length
100 and a maximum of 50 sensors are available. For each array
type under consideration, we appropriately choose the numberof sensors such that the array satisﬁes the aperture constraint of
100. For example, a super nested array has 19 sensors, ULA and
z
1have 50 sensors each, and z3has 27 sensors. Table Vshows
the number of sensors, the maximum number of identiﬁable
DOAs with coarray-MUSIC ( Dm), coupling leakage ( L) calcu-
lated with c=0.3,B=10, and the ﬁrst 5 coarray weights. Note
that the proposed O(N)aperture arrays can ﬁt more sensors in
the available aperture than the O(N2)aperture arrays from the
literature and at the same time, have a smaller coupling leakage
than many of those arrays (except CADiS, which has w(l)=0
for 1≤l≤4).

Fig. 6. MSE when estimating D=20 DOAs uniformly spaced in ωfrom−0.9πto 0.9πwith different arrays under aperture constraint A≤100 and
N≤50. (a) SNR =5d Ba n d K=500, (b)c=0.3a n dK=1000, (c) c=0.3 and SNR =5 dB. Despite high coupling leakage L, ULA performs the best
under low SNR or a small number of snapshots. The proposed array z1performs well at higher SNRs or when a large number of snapshots are available.
CADiS and ULA are found to perform well under very high mutual coupling.
In general, arrays with fewer sensors and sparser sensor
arrangements can help minimize the impact of mutual coupling.However, a smaller number of sensors also means fewer obser-
vations per snapshot, which may result in less accurate DOA
estimation. On the other hand, an array with a larger number of
sensors provides more spatial samples of the impinging signals.
But, under the aperture constraint, the sensors need to be closerto each other on average, which increases the effect of mutual
coupling. Therefore, there is an interesting tradeoff in choosing
the appropriate number of sensors and array geometry when thearray aperture is constrained, and mutual coupling is present.
In Fig. 5, we examine the scenario with D=6 DOAs located
at−0.8π,−0.35π,−0.1π,0.05π,0.4π,0.8πin theωdomain.
The DOAs are spaced non-uniformly unlike the other simula-
tion examples. We compare the MSE of DOA estimation for dif-
ferent arrays constructed under the A≤100 andN≤50 con-
straints. We consider an SNR of 5 dB, coupling strength of c=
0.5, and 500 snapshots, and vary one of these three quantities at
a time to measure its impact on DOA estimation performance.Based on the results, we observe that the proposed O(N)aper-
ture arrays perform signiﬁcantly better than all other O(N
2)
aperture arrays. In particular, from Fig. 5(a) it can be observed
thatO(N)aperture arrays perform better than other arrays even
whenc=0 (i.e. when no mutual coupling is present). This is
becauseO(N)aperture arrays have more sensors than O(N2)
aperture arrays under aperture constraint. From Fig. 5(b) and
5(c) it can be observed that for SNR larger than −10 dB and
more than 100 snapshots, many of the proposed O(N)aperture
sparse arrays perform better than other arrays.
Next, in Fig. 6, we consider D=20 DOAs spaced uniformly
in theωdomain from −0.9πto 0.9π. We consider the same
arrays as in the previous simulation with A≤100 andN≤50.
In Fig. 6(a), when K=500 and SNR is 5 dB, ULA performs
the best for most values of cdespite its large coupling leakage
and smaller aperture compared to the other arrays. A part of the
reason for this may be that ULA has a large number of sensorsand it uses direct root-MUSIC (and not coarray root-MUSIC).
CADiS is also found to perform well for higher values of c.
However, in Fig. 6(b), where c=0.3 andK=1000, we see
thatz
1can perform the best when the SNR is -5dB or more.In Fig. 6(c), where c=0.3 and SNR =5 dB, we observe that
for more than 800 snapshots z1can perform better than ULA.
In Fig. 6(b) and 6(c), when SNR is less than −10 dB, or when
fewer than 800 snapshots are used, ULA is observed to be better
than other arrays despite having large coupling leakage.
D. Some Additional Simulations
The proposed weight-constrained nested arrays with O(N2)
aperture have an advantage when there is no aperture constraint,
and a large number of DOAs need to be identiﬁed under high
mutual coupling. This is demonstrated by the simulation in
Fig. 7. Here, we consider arrays with N=25 sensors. Note
that cMRA [3]is not available for N> 20. Out of the possible
CADiS array conﬁgurations for N=25, we choose the array
withw(l)=0f o r1≤l≤4 to reduce the mutual coupling ef-
fect. SNR of 5 dB, coupling strength c=0.3, and 500 snapshots
are considered. We vary the number of DOAs Dand plot the
MSE for different arrays. We can see that the proposed array
w2has the smallest MSE when 35 ≤D≤80. Also, arrays w(1)
1,
w(2)
1, andw2can identify more DOAs than CADiS.
In Fig. 8, we also plot the MSE for the arrays from Table V
(withA≤100 andN≤50) as the parameter Bin the mutual
coupling model is varied from 10 to 100. We observe that the
general trend of the proposed arrays compared to existing arrays
remains consistent as the parameter Bis changed. This means
that for different values of B, many of the proposed arrays can
still perform better than the existing arrays.
As mentioned at the end of Sec. II-C, although coarray-
based DOA estimation assumes uncorrelated sources, corre-
lated sources can be present in practical situations. To evaluate
the DOA estimation performance of the weight-constrainedsparse arrays proposed in this paper for correlated sources, we
conduct additional simulation experim ents. Using the 16-sensor
arrays from Table IV, 10 DOAs uniformly spaced in the ω-
domain from −0.9πto 0.9πare estimated. Although when
the sources are correlated, the ideal correlations do not have
the sum of sinusoids form as in Eq. ( 12), we still estimate
/hatwideR(l)as in Eq. ( 11) and construct the matrix by /hatwideRfrom Eq.
(13) to estimate DOAs. In Fig. 9, the correlation coefﬁcient

between the second and ﬁfth sources is set to ρe−jπ/4, and
the rest of the sources are uncorrelated. The magnitude of the
correlation coefﬁcient ρis varied on the x-axis to measure its
impact on DOA estimation MSE. We observe that in the absence
of mutual coupling ( c=0), the rate of increase in MSE for most
of the proposed arrays is not signiﬁcantly different from the rateof increase in MSE for other sparse arrays. Moreover, in the
presence of mutual coupling with c=0.4, the proposed arrays
still perform much better than other arrays from the literature,
in the presence of a correlated source pair.
Next, in Fig. 10, we introduce a correlation coefﬁcient of
ρ/2·e
jπ/3between the seventh and ninth source, in addition
to the correlation coefﬁcient of ρe−jπ/4between the second
and ﬁfth source. Thus, there are now two correlated sourcepairs. These numerical results indicate that the proposed arrays
can continue to perform well in the presence of high mutual
coupling and high correlations between a few pairs of sources.Fig. 9. MSE when estimating D=10 DOAs uniformly spaced in ωfrom

E. Main Conclusions From Simulations
The observations from the above numerical simulations can
be summarized as follows. These also serve as a guideline for
the situations in which the proposed arrays can be used and can
be expected to perform well.
For a ﬁxed number of sensors: Whenc>0.2 andD
is large, arrays with w(1)=0o rw(1)=w(2)=0 are nec-
essary to effectively mitigat e the effect of mutual coupling,
and correctly identify all DOAs (Figs. 2and4). Arrays with
w(1)/negationslash=0 perform poorly in this setting. However, there is no
advantage to using arrays with w(1)=0o rw(1)=w(2)=0
whenc<0.2. For a small number of DOAs, O(N)aperture
array having small coarray weights (such as z6) can perform
well (Fig. 3). Proposed arrays with O(N2)aperture are suitable
for identifying a large number of DOAs with smaller errors in
the presence of mutual coupling (Fig. 7). The proposed arrays
also continue to perform well when a few source pairs arecorrelated (Figs. 9and10).
Under aperture constraint: Under ﬁxed aperture, the pro-
posedO(N)aperture arrays can accommodate a larger num-
ber of sensors while still ma intaining low coupling leakage
(Table V). This makes them effective regardless of the mutual
coupling strength when there are only a few DOAs (Fig. 5). For
a larger number of DOAs, some of the proposed arrays (such as
z
1) can perform well provided a high SNR and a larger number
of snapshots are available (Fig. 6). At low SNRs and for a small
number of snapshots, ULA is found to perform the best despite
having high coupling leakage.

Fig. 11. MSE when estimating D=6 DOAs uniformly spaced in ωfrom−0.8πto 0.8πwith 16-sensor arrays using ‘augmented root-MUSIC’ [55].( a )
SNR=5d Ba n d K=500, (b)c=0.5a n dK=500, (c)c=0.5 and SNR =5 dB. These plots are anal ogous to the plots from Fig. 3. We observe here
that because of the use of both ULA segments presen t in the coarrays of weight-constrained sparse a rrays, now many of the proposed arrays can perform at
par or better than other arrays from the literature.
F . Further Enhancing the Performance of Proposed
Weigh-Constrained Sparse Arrays
Note that all the simulations in this section are based on
coarray root-MUSIC. We chose coarray root-MUSIC because it
has theoretical identiﬁability guarantees under i deal conditions,
is conceptually simple to use, and does not require hyperpa-
rameter tuning like some other methods (such as dictionary-
based methods) do. However, because of the DOA estimationalgorithm based on a one-sided coarray segment, the proposed
arrays are at a “disadvantage” compared to the arrays having a
central ULA segment in the coarray. For the arrays with central
ULA segment in the coarray, both sides of the coarray are used
to form the matrix /hatwideR, whereas, for the arrays with central holes
in their coarray (i.e., w(1)=0), only one side of the coarray
is used. Despite this limitation, the proposed arrays have a
smaller MSE compared to previous arrays in the literature in the
presence of mutual coupling under se veral simulation settings.
This already demonstrates the value of our proposed arrays.
However, to further enhance the performance of the proposed
arrays, other DOA estimation algorithms that can use both sides
of the difference coarray should be considered in the future. In
our upcoming work [55], we propose ‘augmented root-MUSIC’
that can utilize the ULA segment s on both sides of the coarrays
with central holes. We have found that for some of the proposed
arrays, the augmented root-MUSIC can have over an order ofmagnitude smaller MSE than coarray root-MUSIC that uses a
one-sided ULA segment. The bas ic idea is to stack the Toeplitz
matrices formed from the ULA segments in the coarray frompositive sides and negative sides. Then, a ‘noise subspace’ in a
much higher dimension is estimated using the SVD of the aug-
mented matrix. The details will be explained in [55].H e r ew e
provide one simulation example to demonstrate its advantage.
We rerun the simulations from Fig. 3using the augmented
root-MUSIC algorithm [55]. The resulting plots are shown in
Fig. 11. Note that in Fig. 3, only array z
6performed better
than other arrays from the literature. Whereas in Fig. 11above
using augmented root-MUSIC, many of the proposed arrays
now have over an order of magnitude smaller MSE than earlier
and perform at par or better than arrays from the literature.As another future direction, the central holes in the coarrays
can be ﬁlled using appropriate coarray interpolation techniques
[56],[57],[58]. However, it can be challenging to incorporate
mutual coupling into such algorithms. Once the central holes areappropriately ﬁlled through interpolation, we can use the central
ULA segment in coarray instead of the one-sided segment.
These directions will be explored in our future work.
VII. C
ONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we introduced new weight-constrained sparse
arrays that are robust to the presence of high mutual coupling.
We argued that with a large number of sensors N, we may not
always require O(N2)degrees of freedom, and O(N2)length
aperture of such sparse arrays can be impractical for various
applications. To better accommodate aperture constraints andhigh mutual coupling, we proposed two modiﬁcations to the
array design criteria and presented several O(N)aperture ar-
rays with either w(1)=0o rw(1)=w(2)=0. Many of these
arrays can s till identify D>N DOAs (such as D=2N)u s -
ing coarray-MUSIC on a one-sided ULA segment present in
the coarray. These arrays are obtained by appropriately dilat-ing a ULA and augmenting it with a few additional sensors.
Through Monte-Carlo simulations, we demonstrated that these
new arrays can outperform existing arrays from the literatureunder high mutual coupling or aper ture constrai nt conditions.
Additionally, we proposed another type of arrays with w(1)=
0o rw(1)=w(2)=0 andO(N
2)aperture, called weight-
constrained nested arrays, which are suitable for identifying
a large number of DOAs under high mutual coupling whenaperture is not constrained.
The theme of an ‘aperture-aware’ array design introduced
in this work can be further explored to design sparse arrayssystematically under aperture constraints. Several interesting
array design questi ons arise under such a s etting. For exam-
ple, given a ﬁxed aperture Aand a ﬁxed number of sensors
N<A , it would be of interest to know the sensor arrangement
that leads to the lowest mutual coupling and gives the best
DOA estimation performance. Furthermore, similar to the 1D
